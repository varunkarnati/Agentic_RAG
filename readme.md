
# 🚀 RAG Crew AI - Agentic AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview

This project demonstrates an advanced agentic AI implementation, integrating **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques using **CrewAI** and **LangGraph**. It showcases how multiple AI agents collaborate effectively to automate complex information retrieval tasks with enhanced accuracy and contextual understanding.

## 💡 What is Included?

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines document retrieval and language generation to improve the relevance of AI outputs.
- **CrewAI Framework:** Coordinates multiple AI agents working collaboratively towards complex objectives.
- **LangGraph Workflows:** Manages interactions between agents through structured, graph-based decision-making processes.

## 🛠 Technologies & Frameworks

- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **CrewAI**
- **LangGraph**
- **Sentence Transformers** (for semantic embeddings)
- **OpenAI API (via Groq integration)**

## ⚙️ Project Features

- **PDF-based RAG queries:** Retrieve and analyze information directly from PDFs.
- **Agentic AI workflows:** Clearly define roles, responsibilities, and workflows among multiple AI agents.
- **Advanced embeddings:** Leverage pre-trained Sentence Transformer models for better document understanding.

## 📌 Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd RAG_Crew_AI
# Install dependencies manually as needed, e.g.,
# pip install langchain crewai langgraph sentence-transformers openai
```

## 🚩 How to Use

Run the provided Jupyter notebook (`RAG_Crew_AI.ipynb`) to:

- Load and process PDF documents.
- Perform AI-powered retrieval and queries.
- Experiment with custom agentic workflows.

## 🎯 Example Use Case

Quickly retrieve detailed insights about companies or topics directly from PDFs:

```python
response = rag_tool.run("What does Sporo Health do?")
print(response)
```
